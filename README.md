<h1>The goal of a Project</h1>
<hr>
<p>
The goal of my Flask project is to create a website where users can easily view information about crypto they own and manage their holdings. After registering on CRYPTEX, users will be able to add widgets for each cryptocurrency they own, specifying the type of a coin and the amount they have. These widgets will be displayed on the Home Page for a quick and easy access.

To get the necessary data about each cryptocurrency, the website will be using the Binance API, which provides real-time information on cryptocurrency prices, market trends, and more. This data will be stored in a database and used to update the user's holdings and widget displays.

My website will have three or more tables in a database that are properly connected with each other. 

Overall, the website will provide a streamlined way for users to track their cryptocurrency investments and stay informed about the profit they made on crypto.
